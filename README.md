# Multi-Approach-Similarity-Based-Article-Bias-Prediction-using-LSTM
    
The python version used is v3.8.8. Other libraries are mentioned in requirements.txt.
It is to be noted that some additional libraries may be required to be intsalled which comes with the libraries mentioned in requiretments.txt.
For example: torchvision that comes with torch, etc. Howveer, all efforts are made to mention all relevant libraries.

============================================================

There are 4 main .py codes and rest are supporting codes:
1. LSTM Baseline - biasLSTM_100_Final2LSTM.py
2. LSTM + Co-Matching - biasLSTM_100_Final2LSTM_COMATCHING.py
3. LSTM + Entailment - biasLSTM_100_Final2LSTM_ENTAILMENT.py
4. LSTM + Multihead - biasLSTM_100_Final2LSTM_MHA.py

------------------------------------------------------------

The supporting .py scripts required for each main .py codes:
1. LSTM Baseline - W2V2.py
2. LSTM + Co-Matching - W2V3.py
3. LSTM + Entailment - W2V3.py
4. LSTM + Multihead - W2V3.py

============================================================

All codes were initially written in jupyter notebooks (.ipynb format) and all the experiments were performed in the same format.
It was later downloaded as .py files.

============================================================

Steps to be followed to run the code from terminal:

>> python filename.py
